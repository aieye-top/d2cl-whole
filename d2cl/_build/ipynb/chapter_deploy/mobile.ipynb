    "Embedded and mobile devices have low-processor with little memory, which makes the process slow and expensive to compute. Often, we can try some tricks such as reducing network size, quantizing the weights, and distilling knowledge.\n",
    "Both pruning and quantization are model compression techniques that make the model physically smaller to save disk space and make the model require less memory during computation to run faster.\n",
    "Knowledge distillation is a compression technique in which a small “student” model is trained to reproduce the behavior of a large “teacher” model.\n",
    "Embedded and mobile PyTorch/TensorFlow frameworks are less fully featured than the full PyTorch/TensorFlow frameworks. Therefore, we have to be careful with the model architecture. An alternative option is using the interchange format.\n",
    "Mobile machine learning frameworks are regularly in flux: Tensorflow Lite, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML, MLKit, FritzAI.\n",
    "The best solution in the industry for embedded devices is NVIDIA.\n",
    "The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX for short) is designed to allow framework interoperability.[2]\n",
